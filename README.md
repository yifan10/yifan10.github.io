# ShopifyFrontEndInternChanllenge

The project is done by javascript, html and css.

Every page has two image to show. The page will introduce the images to you. You can like or unlike the images at any time if you want.

It contains the function to submit the start_date. After you submit a reasonable date, the page will show the first two images starting from that date.
(Pay attention: if the start_date is too far from today, the loading time will be very long)

If no start_date is submitted (every time you fresh or create a new page), two random images will be shown.

It also contains a shareable link to facebook for you to share the images with your friends.

If the image is not shown, please refresh the page.

To access the page, you can go to yifan10.github.io :)
